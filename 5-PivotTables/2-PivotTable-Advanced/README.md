Pivot Tables — Advanced
-
In this project, I worked with advanced Pivot Table techniques to analyze data using hierarchical structures. By combining multiple fields in rows, I created clear parent-child relationships, such as countries broken down into specific job titles, making patterns easier to spot.

I used value fields to calculate metrics like average salary within each level of the hierarchy and sorted results directly inside the Pivot Table to highlight top and bottom performers. I also adjusted report layouts to switch between compact, outline, and tabular views depending on whether the focus was readability or deeper analysis.

To improve accuracy, I filtered out empty or zero-value results and drilled into individual values to view the underlying data. I also grouped related items manually to create custom categories and used percentage-based views to understand how each group contributes to overall totals.

These techniques allowed me to move beyond simple summaries and perform more flexible, insight-driven analysis using Pivot Tables.
