Pivot Tables 
-
Pivot Tables allow me to quickly explore and summarize large datasets without changing the original data. They helped me turn raw job data into meaningful insights by counting, grouping, filtering, and comparing values dynamically.

In this project, I used Pivot Tables to analyze job titles, countries, and other attributes by dragging fields into rows, columns, values, and filters. This made it easy to answer questions like how many roles exist per job title or how data jobs are distributed by country.

I also worked with interactive filters to narrow results, applied value-based and label-based filtering, and refreshed Pivot Tables to reflect changes in the source data. Styling options such as banded rows, headers, and grand totals improved readability and presentation.

Overall, Pivot Tables were essential for fast analysis, flexible exploration, and building structured insights from complex datasets.
