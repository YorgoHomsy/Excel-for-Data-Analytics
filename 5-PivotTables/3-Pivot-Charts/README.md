Pivot Charts
-
Pivot Charts allowed me to turn Pivot Table insights into interactive visualizations. By linking charts directly to Pivot Tables, I was able to explore questions like which data roles pay the most, which jobs are in highest demand, and how hiring trends change over time.

I used built-in chart filters to sort roles by metrics such as average salary and added slicers to let users dynamically filter results by job attributes. Timelines made it easy to analyze trends across dates, while filter connections allowed slicers to control multiple charts across different worksheets.

Overall, Pivot Charts helped me create flexible, user-driven visuals that update instantly and support deeper, more intuitive data exploration.
