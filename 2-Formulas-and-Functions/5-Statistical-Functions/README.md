I learned to use Excel’s statistical functions to summarize and analyze data. This includes:

MEDIAN — finds the middle value, useful when data has outliers

STDEV — measures how spread out numbers are

QUARTILE.INC / QUARTILE.EXC — divide data into 4 parts to understand distribution; QUARTILE.EXC ignores extremes

MODE — identifies the most frequent value

RANK — determines the position of a value compared to others
