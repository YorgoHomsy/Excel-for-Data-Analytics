I learned to use Excel’s logical functions to control workflow and decision-making in spreadsheets. This includes:

IF — test a condition and return values for TRUE or FALSE

IF + AND — combine multiple conditions; all must be TRUE

IF + OR — combine multiple conditions; any can be TRUE

IFS — evaluate multiple sequential conditions without nesting, with an optional TRUE fallback

I also learned how to create dynamic logical formulas for analysis, grading, and conditional outputs.
