I learned how to use Excel’s built-in functions to perform calculations efficiently. This includes finding functions through the Insert Function tool, understanding how functions are organized (especially statistical functions), and applying conditional logic using functions like COUNTIF. I also learned how to build dynamic criteria by referencing cells correctly instead of hard-coding values.
