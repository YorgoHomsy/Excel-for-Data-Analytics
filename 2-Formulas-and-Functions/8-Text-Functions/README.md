In this section, I explored some powerful text tools in Excel that help make messy data usable and meaningful.

TEXTJOIN lets you combine multiple values into one clean, comma-separated string, skipping blanks automatically.

TEXTSPLIT is the reverse , it breaks one string into separate pieces, perfect for splitting addresses, lists, or CSV data.

UNIQUE with TRANSPOSE helps pull out distinct values from a row, turning them into a neat vertical list.

COUNTIF counts how often something appears, which is great for tracking occurrences or frequency.

SORT quickly organizes data by a chosen column, from highest to lowest or vice versa, making analysis easier.

These functions together make working with text faster, cleaner, and more flexible, especially when dealing with large or inconsistent datasets.
