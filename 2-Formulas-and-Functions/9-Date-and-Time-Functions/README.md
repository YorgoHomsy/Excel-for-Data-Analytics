Date & Time Functions
-
In this section, I explored how Excel handles dates and times, and how to manipulate them for analysis.

DAY, MONTH, YEAR let you pull out the parts of a date so you can work with them individually.

DATE and TIME help you build valid dates or times from separate numbers.

TODAY always gives the current date, while DATEDIF lets you calculate how many days, months, or years separate two dates.

HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND extract the components of a time, and TEXT lets you format them nicely.

Using SEQUENCE and COUNTIF, you can analyze patterns, like how many events happen at each hour of the day.

These functions make it easy to break down, combine, and analyze dates and times in real-life datasets.
