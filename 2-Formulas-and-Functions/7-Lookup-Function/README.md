What I Learned
-
Mastered Excel functions for finding and mapping values across tables, enabling fast, dynamic lookups and conditional mapping without helper columns.

Key Functions
-
VLOOKUP – vertical lookup; find a value in the first column of a table and return a value from another column.

HLOOKUP – horizontal lookup; same as VLOOKUP but searches rows.

XLOOKUP – modern, flexible replacement for VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP; supports exact/approximate matches, defaults, and reverse search.

MATCH – returns the position of a value in a range; used for ranking text or as a helper for INDEX.

INDEX – retrieves the value at a specific position in a range.

LOOKUP – legacy function for approximate matching.
