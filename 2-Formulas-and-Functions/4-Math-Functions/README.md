I learned to use Excel’s math functions to perform calculations efficiently on datasets. This includes:

SUM — add numbers or ranges

SUMIF / SUMIFS — sum based on one or multiple conditions

AVERAGE / AVERAGEIF / AVERAGEIFS — calculate mean values with or without conditions

COUNT / COUNTA / COUNTIF / COUNTIFS — count numbers, non-empty cells, or cells meeting criteria

MIN / MAX / MINIFS / MAXIFS — find smallest or largest values, optionally with conditions
