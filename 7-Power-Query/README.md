# Power Query M-language

This repo showcases what I learned and practiced in **Power Query M-language** through my Data Analytics course.

---

## Here’s what I explored and achieved

- **Loading and transforming data**  
  I worked with Excel datasets and learned how to **shape tables exactly the way I needed** — promoting headers, changing types, adjusting salaries, and adding calculated columns.

- **Custom Columns**  
  I created my own formulas to compute **yearly salaries** and classify **job levels**. Writing these custom formulas taught me how to think logically in **M-language** and solve problems dynamically.

- **Add Column From Examples**  
  I discovered how to “teach Excel” what I want in a new column **just by giving examples**. It was amazing to see Excel automatically generate the right M formula.

- **Reordering and organizing data**  
  I practiced **moving columns** like posting date, month, and hour next to each other without creating extra steps — it showed me how **small adjustments can make tables cleaner and more readable**.

- **Handling errors and step references**  
  I learned the importance of **referencing the correct previous step** when adding columns. Copying lines from one query to another taught me to **check carefully for commas, correct step names, and logical order** to avoid errors.
