Power Query
-
Power Query allowed me to automate how data is imported and prepared in Excel. Instead of manually copying and cleaning data, I used Power Query to connect to files, folders, and web sources and keep everything refreshable.

I worked with single-file imports, combined multiple files from a folder into one dataset, and loaded results directly into tables, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts for fast analysis. One of the biggest advantages was the ability to simply refresh data when new files were added, without rebuilding anything.

Overall, Power Query helped me build cleaner, more scalable workflows and handle growing datasets efficiently while reducing manual work.
