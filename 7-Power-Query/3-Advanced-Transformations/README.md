# Advanced Transformations (Power Query)

## Overview

This section covers how I use **Advanced Transformations** in **Power Query** to clean, transform, and prepare data before analysis.

This project goes beyond basic data cleaning and focuses on reshaping messy, real-world data into **analysis-ready structures** using Power Query.

I worked with raw job and skills data that wasn’t designed for analysis and transformed it into a format that works smoothly with **PivotTables** and **charts**.

## What I Learned and Applied

- Building **modular queries** using *Duplicate* and *Reference* to explore data without breaking the original source  
- Cleaning **inconsistent text values** so categories like skills and sources are standardized and reliable  
- Reshaping wide data into long format using **Unpivot** to enable filtering, grouping, and visualization  
- Breaking complex text fields into analyzable parts (e.g. skill lists → individual skills)  
- Grouping data meaningfully to remove repetition and extract clear summaries  
- Creating **derived columns** to align metrics (e.g. hourly vs yearly values) for fair comparison  
- Optimizing transformation steps for **clarity, performance, and reuse**

## Outcome

The final result is a **flexible, refreshable data model** that feeds PivotTables and PivotCharts without manual cleanup, making analysis:

- Faster  
- Cleaner  
- More reliable
