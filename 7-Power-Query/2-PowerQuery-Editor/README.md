Power Query Editor
-
This section covers how I use **Power Query Editor** to clean, transform, and prepare data before analysis.

I learned how to turn **raw, messy data** into **structured, reliable datasets** by applying step-by-step transformations that stay linked to the original source. Instead of manually fixing data every time, Power Query lets me build a **repeatable workflow** that updates automatically when the data changes.

## What I worked with
- Importing data from **files, folders, and the web**
- Understanding and managing **query steps**
- Cleaning data by **removing rows, columns, and unwanted values**
- Fixing **data types** (text, numbers, dates) correctly
- Transforming values **without breaking the original data**
- Creating **new calculated columns** for analysis
- Optimizing queries by **reducing unnecessary steps**
- Connecting cleaned data directly to **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**

## Key takeaway 
The biggest takeaway is learning to think in **data pipelines**: once the logic is built, refreshing the data updates everything downstream automatically.
