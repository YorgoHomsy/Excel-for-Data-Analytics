# Power Query — Append vs Merge


In this project, I explored how to **combine and join data** in Power Query to make my analysis more powerful and flexible.

---

## Append

- I used **Append** when I had multiple monthly job files.  
- This allowed me to **stack all rows together** without losing any detail.  
- By doing this, I could pivot, analyze **trends over time**, and build dashboards easily.  
- Adding new months became as simple as **appending and refreshing — no rework needed**.

---

## Merge

- I used **Merge** to combine tables based on **key columns**, like connecting employees to their salaries.  
- Depending on the merge type (**Left, Right, Inner, Full**), I could **control which rows to keep or match**, giving me flexibility to explore relationships in the data.

## Insights

- From these transformations, I was able to see **top skills for jobs**, and analyze their **frequency versus average salary**, helping me understand what skills are most valuable in the job market.

This project shows how I used Power Query to **clean, combine, and analyze data efficiently**, turning raw files into **actionable insights**.
