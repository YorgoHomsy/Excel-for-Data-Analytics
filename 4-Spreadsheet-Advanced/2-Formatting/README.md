Table Formatting
-
In this section, I learned how to format tables to make data easier to read and insights easier to spot.

Basic cell formatting like bold text and borders helps structure tables clearly.

Conditional formatting adds meaning by visually highlighting values using data bars, color scales, and icons.

I learned how to control conditional formatting so it applies to the right rows or cells, not the entire table.

Formula-based rules made it possible to highlight values dynamically and consistently across rows.

Tools like Format Painter help reuse styles while keeping the logic intact.

Overall, table formatting turns raw data into clear, visual, and insight-driven tables that are easier to understand at a glance.
