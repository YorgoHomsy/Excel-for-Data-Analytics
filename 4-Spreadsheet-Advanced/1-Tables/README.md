Tables Introduction
-
In this section, I learned how Excel tables make working with data cleaner, safer, and more dynamic.

Converting data into a table keeps everything structured, so sorting and filtering always apply to the full dataset.

Tables automatically expand and inherit formatting when new rows or columns are added.

Using structured references makes formulas easier to read and more reliable.

Total rows allow quick calculations, while functions like AGGREGATE offer more flexibility.

Slicers add an interactive layer, making tables easier to explore and filter without touching the raw data.

Overall, tables turn static ranges into interactive, scalable datasets that are much easier to manage and analyze.
