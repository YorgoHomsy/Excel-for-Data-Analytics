Charts Introduction
-
In this section, I learned how to use charts to turn raw data into clear visual stories.

Line charts are best for time-based data, helping reveal trends and patterns over time. I focused on using clear titles that communicate the key message, often framed as a question.

Pie charts are useful for showing proportions, but only when categories are limited. I learned to keep them clean by reducing colors and formatting labels as percentages for clarity.

Column and bar charts are ideal for comparing values across categories. Bar charts work especially well when labels are long, while sorting data correctly helps highlight rankings from lowest to highest.

I also learned how to hide or show data series without changing the original dataset, keeping charts flexible and easy to adjust.

Overall, this section helped me understand how chart choice, sorting, and formatting directly affect how clearly insights are communicated.
