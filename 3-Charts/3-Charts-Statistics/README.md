Statistical Charts
-
In this section, I learned how to use statistical charts to understand how data is distributed and how groups compare.

Histograms helped me analyze the spread of a single numeric variable by grouping values into bins, making it easier to spot patterns, ranges, and outliers. Adjusting bin size and cleaning extreme values improved clarity.

Box plots made it easy to compare medians and variability across different groups, highlighting differences that aren’t obvious from averages alone.

These charts are especially useful when the goal is to understand distributions, compare groups, and spot anomalies rather than just visualize totals.
