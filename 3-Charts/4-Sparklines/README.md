Sparklines
-
In this section, I learned how to summarize trends at a glance using sparklines—tiny charts inside cells that show patterns without all the axes and labels.

Line sparklines are perfect for horizontal data, letting you see increases, decreases, and overall trends across a row.

You can highlight the high and low points, or the start and end, to make key moments stand out.

Customizing marker colors helps differentiate important points, keeping the mini charts clear and easy to interpret.

Sparklines are great for dashboards and summary tables, giving a quick visual sense of trends without taking up much space.
