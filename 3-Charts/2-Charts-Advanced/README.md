Advanced Charts

In this section, I focused on using scatter plots to analyze relationships between numerical variables and extract deeper insights from data.

I learned how to properly set up scatter charts using numeric fields only, then refine them by adjusting axis bounds and formatting values to make large numbers easier to read. I also worked on improving clarity by adding meaningful axis titles and linking them dynamically to worksheet cells.

To identify insights like the highest-paying jobs, I added job titles as data labels instead of chart data, allowing text information to appear cleanly on the visualization. The final step was manual cleanup—repositioning labels to reduce overlap and improve readability.

Overall, this helped me understand how formatting, labeling, and scale control turn a raw scatter plot into a clear analytical tool.
