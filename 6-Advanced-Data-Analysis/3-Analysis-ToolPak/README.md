Analysis ToolPak
-
In this project, I used Excel’s Analysis ToolPak to quickly understand and explore numeric data. I worked with descriptive statistics to summarize datasets using key measures such as averages, spread, and range, which helped build an initial understanding before deeper analysis.

I also used the Histogram tool to visualize data distributions and identify patterns more clearly. By adjusting bin ranges, I improved readability and gained better insight into how values are concentrated across intervals.

Overall, the Analysis ToolPak helped me move faster from raw numbers to meaningful insights by combining statistical summaries with clear visual analysis.
