Analysis Add-ins
-
In this project, I used Excel’s Analysis Add-ins to explore future trends and test different decision scenarios. I worked with Forecast Sheets to predict values based on historical data and adjust confidence levels and seasonality to better understand uncertainty.

I also applied What-If Analysis tools to evaluate how changes in inputs affect outcomes. Scenario Manager helped compare multiple compensation scenarios side by side, while Goal Seek was used to find the exact input needed to reach a specific target. For more complex cases, I used Solver to adjust multiple variables at once and apply constraints to keep results realistic.

These tools allowed me to move beyond static analysis and make data-driven decisions by modeling outcomes, testing assumptions, and optimizing results.
