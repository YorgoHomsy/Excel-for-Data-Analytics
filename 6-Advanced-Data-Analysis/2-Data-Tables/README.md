Data Tables
-
Data Tables helped me analyze how changes in one or two inputs impact a final result at scale. Instead of testing values one by one, I used Data Tables to quickly compare outcomes across a full range of scenarios.

In this project, I applied Data Tables to evaluate how different annual raise percentages affect total compensation. By varying inputs vertically or both vertically and horizontally, I was able to see sensitivity patterns and understand how small changes influence results.

This approach made it easier to explore “what-if” questions, compare scenarios side by side, and make more informed, data-driven decisions.
